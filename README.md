# moat
A fritzing project to build a semi modular pocket synth. An analog companion to Bastl instruments Kastle. 

# This is not finished ;)

It's missing a TL805 (or the like) and the form factor ist too 'full' at the moment. I originally built this with Bastl Instruments Omsynth Breadboard kit:

And haven't moved some of the things from Omsynth into the plain breadboard design.
