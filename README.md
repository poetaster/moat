# moat / Keep
A fritzing project to build a semi modular pocket synth. An analog companion to Bastl instruments Kastle. 
Find Kastle source here: https://github.com/bastl-instruments/kastle 

Moat, unlike Kastle, is analog. It uses simple switching (pulse waves), a frequency divider and an XR 2206. And primitive filters. It sequences using the divider :) 

It's a self-sequencing, semi-modular, pocket synth. Props to minimo, bastl, minty synth etc!

# Version 2 is now usable. Produced PCBs

Well, version 2 is more or less finished. I simplified it substantially to fit in an altoids tin and still be playable. Version 2 PCBs assembled prove to be working.

Further refinements are ongoing.


It's missing a 7805 (or the like) and the form factor ist too 'full' at the moment. I originally built this with Bastl Instruments Omsynth Breadboard kit:
