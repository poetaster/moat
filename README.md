# moat / Keep
A fritzing project to build a semi modular pocket synth. An analog companion to Bastl instruments Kastle. 
Find Kastle source here: https://github.com/bastl-instruments/kastle 

Moat, unlike Kastle, is analog. It uses simple switching (pulse waves), a frequency divider and an XR 2206. And primitive filters. It sequences using the divider :)

It's a self-sequencing, semi-modular, pocket synth. Props to minimo, bastl, minty synth etc!

## Moat, file Version 2 is now usable. Produced PCBs

Well, version 2 is more or less finished. I simplified it substantially to fit in an altoids tin and still be playable. Version 2 PCBs assembled prove to be working.

Version 3, with name change from moat (reserved for a future project) to keep is now also production ready. Yeah! Version 3 was made for 2 reasons. 1, clarify the layout (moving the sequence mixing from the top to the side) and make patching a bit easier and 2, reducing the size by about a 10 mm in the horizontal and 3 in the vertical. This makes it possible to put in an altoid tin.

Further refinements are ongoing.


It's missing a 7805 (or the like). I originally built this with Bastl Instruments Omsynth Breadboard kit:
